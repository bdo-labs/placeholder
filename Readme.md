Placeholder
===========

Slick input placeholders. Instead of text-disappearing completely, it is
placed above the element in question with a subtle transition.

To use it, simply include the directive in your app and add placeholders.
Choosing `placeholder` as the name of the directive will make the change
take affect on your existing placeholders, Yay!
